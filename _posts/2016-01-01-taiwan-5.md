We started off the morning "hiking" along Lushui Trail, which overlooked the grotto we walked along
yesterday. At one point my aunt said "Carefully, rock", which I found hilarious because not only
are we looking at huge rocks, our path is completely rocks so who knows which one she was referring
to.

We stopped at Cimu Bridge, which looks over huge marble boulders. It's weird to see so much natural
marble in one place. Even during our hike, the huge mountains we were walking around were all
marble.

One of Taroko's most famous landmarks is Eternal Spring Shrine. The water rushing out below it is
from within the mountain.

On our way out of Taroko, a rogue bus came directly toward us and wouldn't budge even though the road was
too narrow. Our driver and all the cars behind us had to back up along the windy, cliff-y road for
this guy. We stopped for lunch and had a set menu that wasn't spectacular, but we had sunfish which
was really interesting and yummy. The meat itself is chewy and then there's a whole layer of fatty, chewy,
jelly bits too.

We stopped at a cliff that overlooked what I think is the bluest water I have ever seen.

We got dropped off at our hotel by Taipei Main Station. It was just the 10th and 11th floors of
a big buidling, which was weird. We did some laundry, but I forgot to check the lint in the dryer
and our load might've been kind of big, so our clothes were still a little moist and we ended up
hanging them all over the room to dry.

Some of us ventured out to explore while the others did laundry. I got some more taro milk tea, but
it didn't even compare to that other place in Kaoshiung.

There was a big department store across the street and I found these tiny bananas in the market at
the bottom.

After laundry was done, we all went out for beef noodles. I really like these thick knife-cut
noodles.

After dinner, a couple of us went on an adventure to find Ningxia Tourist Night Market. Google Maps
said it was just a 18 min walk, but right by the hotel, the street looked like it turned into
a highway so we started asking around for directions. The map we got from the hotel was all in
Chinese characters and it was too small/dark for my mom to read the map and the street signs so we
were already off to a rocky start. It's pretty hard trying to match Chinese characters to street
signs. People were really nice when we asked for directions, but they didn;t seem very familiar
with the roads. They all spoke really good English and really wanted to help us find this night
market. We ended up abandoning our Google Maps walking directions and following the guidance of
these nice strangers. We wanted to walk and take in the city, instead of taking the MRT. One person
said it would be easier to walk along the subway streets than the surface streets, but we got lost
underground so we ended up taking the MRT anyway. Eventually we found the night market, which was
mostly food jsut like I like 'em.

I waited in a long line for some kind of sticky rice creation but she eventually waved the end of
the line away because she ran out.

I got another taro milk tea and again was sad that it wasn't even comparable to the one in
Kaoshiung.

The MRT was closed by the time we wanted to leave the night market so we walked and surprisingly
made it back. The streets were empty around 11pm, unlike Hong Kong so I probably wouldn't have
walked if I wasn't with a group of people.
