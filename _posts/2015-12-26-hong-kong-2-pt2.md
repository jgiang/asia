We left Stanley Market to go to Aberdeen, an old fishing village. We took a boat tour around the
old fishing boats, which turned out to be so fun. There was a big floating restaurant called
"Jumbo" that is supposed to be good for dim sum.

We stopped at Causebay Way to see Times Square. I was expected a copy of New York's Time Square but
it was just a 8-floor indoor mall. It was pretty boring so we explored the area around it and
walked to a little street market.

Instead of heading back to the hotel, we requested to be dropped off at the Ladies' Market. Again,
it was much like chinatown. Just lots of stands with tourist-y/junk-y stuff. It was even longer
than the Temple Street market, so we spent quite a lot of time walking through the stalls.

We walked back to our hotel, stopping at [Green Land Restaurant](http://www.openrice.com/zh/hongkong/restaurant/%E9%8A%85%E9%91%BC%E7%81%A3-%E8%AD%9A%E4%BB%94%E9%9B%B2%E5%8D%97%E7%B1%B3%E7%B7%9A/46583) for dinner.

After chilling out at the hotel for a bit, some of us went back to Temple Street Night Market to
eat some street food. We saw it last night, but had just eaten dinner, so today was the day. We
settled on a super popular seafood place. It was kind of price-y for street food, but worth it for
the experience. The mantis shrimps were my favorite but they were a pain to eat; there was so
little meat for the effort required.

We walked a little farther to see if Australia Dairy Company was still open, but it wasn't :( We
also came across another intersection serving seafood, which we would probably try if we were to go
again. They had some kind of shrimps that were like 5x the size of our sad little mantis shrimps.
