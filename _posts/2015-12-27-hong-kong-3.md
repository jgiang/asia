My dad is always awake first but this time we were all in one room and he wasn't familiar with
the light button board so he just turned on the bathroom light and went in there to post pictures on
Facebook LOL. Some people went out first to explore and came back with fresh egg tarts! I stayed in
to research how to get to the Big Buddha in Lantau.

Before getting on the MTR, we had dim sum at China Town Restaurant (I can't find the link but it
was probably 2/F Nathan Square, 348 Nathan Road, Jordan), which had "Michelin
recommended" signs.

We got on the MTR, heading to Tung Chung.

From Tung Chung station, we had the option of taking the Ngong Ping Cable Car or the 23 bus to the
Big Buddha. The wait for the cable car tickets was about 2 hours and the bus ride would only take about 40
minutes, so we opted for the bus. It was really foggy so navigating the area was difficult. We got
tickets to go inside the base of the statue, which is a little museum. The tickets also included
meals at the vegetarian cafe run by the monastery. The tofu fa was really smooth. I generally don't
like it at dim sum because it usually feels gritty.

There wasn't a line to buy cable car tickets at this end of the line, so we decided to take it back
down to Tung Chung. It was impossible to see anything because of the fog. We basically just had
white backdrop the whole ride, which made it super easy for my mom, who is terrified of heights
(she was planning on keeping her eyes closed for the whole 25 min ride).

My aunt found a whole birthday cake from the hotel when we got back. That was so
thoughtful of them.

After a little break, we walked down to Tsim Sha Tsui to see the Symphony of Lights, which we
missed the other day. The view was great during the wait. I love the colors of the lights on the
water. The actually light show, however, sucked. It was kind of pathetic compared to the stuff you
see at Vegas or World of Color at Disneyland. Everyone has probably seen better light shows on houses
during Christmas.

We walked by the Clock Tower on our way to dinner. We decided to go to [Crystal Jade](http://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/tsim-sha-tsui-crystal-jade-la-mian-xiao-long-bao/10639) because an
uncle and family friend recommended it. It was inside a really ritzy shopping center so we had
entertainment during the 40 min wait, but most of us were too tired to be intereested. The food was
okay, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone that has been to Din Tai Fung, which is way
better.

On our walk home, we stopped by Australia Dairy Company again. We ordered right before they took
down the menu! I got a milk tea and the milk pudding, but cold this time. I definitely like the hot
version way better.
