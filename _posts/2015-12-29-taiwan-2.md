The breakfast buffet was just as huge as dinner. I'm not a breakfast person so my plate never
really looks great, hence the lack of pictures, but my go-tos are hot soy milk, congee with dried
pork, and fruit. After breakfast I went exploring the hotel. It's quite nice.

We got to the tour bus early to get seats. After this first day, your neighbors on the bus are set
in stone, but seats are rotated two rows forward so that you get to experience all parts of the bus
LOL. I had totally forgotten about my mom always sitting in the front of the tour buses we went on
when I was a kid. They always reserve the first row for people that get car-sick and she was always
the lone wolf at the front, usually making the tour guide her new buddy. The seat rotations usually meant
that we would all be reunited every couple of days. This time, the rest of us sat in the back so we
could all be together. My mom came down to join us for a selfie.

Our first stop was a temple that collapsed in a big earthquake. Many people died so they
decided to leave it as is to honor them and built another one in front of it. There was a little
market next to it and we got durian candies (they're so potent, I had to chew gum before getting
back on the bus)!

Our second stop was an old railway station, but there wasn't much to see.

We got a lesson on the fruits of Taiwan, which was so fun. I'm really excited for custard apples!
This tour is so much more entertaining than past ones. I don't remember learning fun facts and
stuff before. I mostly remember really long boring bus rides, but they may have played Mr Bean and
stuff on the tiny tvs occasionally. Did you know that tomatoes are usually treated as fruits in
North Taiwan (snack with plum sauce) and vegetables in the South (prepared in savory foods)?

Our main stop of the day was at Fo Guang Shan Buddha, which is bigger than the Buddha we saw in
Hong Kong, and might be the biggest in the world. Fprtunately, it was an absolutely clear, sunny
day and visibility wasn't an issue like it was in Hong Kong.

On our way up to the Buddha, we stopped by a park with a bunch of these little guys, which I refer
to as "little Buddhas", scattered about. I really wish I could've taken a selfie with every single
one. They're my favorite character(?) right after Eeyore.

We had some time to kill so we went for another little walk around the pavilion. We had a great
time captioning these murals. My mom would read the first two characters or so and basically guess
what the meaning of each was. Us illiterate types would look at the pictures and come up with our
own story. We were usually quicker and (we think) more accurate!

We stopped to look at the sunset from Love River in Kaoshiung to ensure that the night market
stalls were all set up when we arrived.

We also drove by Banana Pier, a famous spot in Kaoshiung Harbor. I don't remember if it got its
name because they used to ship bananas or because the big building is a really banana-yellow.
Neither of those reasons explain why this statue exists; someone give him a belt.

The Liouhe Tourist Night Market was our first night market of the trip. I got BONELESS chicken
feet! They were served cold, which was weird but they were a nice combo of salty and spicy. Papaya
milk is supposed to be a famous night market drink but I wasn't a big fan. It tasted more like milk
than I expected. The stinky tofu was so good. It looked like they fried it twice so it was extra
cripsy. The best snack was fried quail eggs though. They were so cute and you can't go wrong with
salt-and-peppered fried eggs.

After checking in to our hotel, we walked to Ziqiang Night Market. My mom, our only translator, wasn't feeling 
well so she stayed in her room. Once we got to the food, we split up into two groups: street-food
people and non-street-food people. Neither groups can speak/read Chinese so there were lots of fun
stories.

I was with three other people looking for good street food. We saw a dumpling stand with lots of
people so we got in line, but realized there wasn't any English on the signs. We got a table by
signaling that we had four people. The guy moved someone over so we could join their table. We asked for 
a menu but they don't have any! Here's where the fun starts. We point to the dumpling plate of the
guy eating next to us (poor guy had to endure all of our shenanigans) and stick two fingers up. Somehow we 
convey that we want two of what our neighbor has. The guy came back point to our neighbor again and
sticking two fingers up again, making us question if we actually ordered our dumplings yet. After
a whole lot of confusion, he walked away and we were left waiting for our *hopefully* ordered food.
We concluded that he was probably trying to ask if we wanted to try the soup. The dumplings were
*SO* good. The outside wasn't amazing (din tai fung is better), but the inside was super juicy and
yummy. When we were ready to pay we just waved 1000 dollars (not sure what the currency is called
so they'll be dollars for now) in the air, which got the message
across perfectly. The other group of us apparently tried to ask for the check in Chinese or
something and ended up getting toothpicks for the table LOL. Anyway, we just gave them 1000 because
we had no clue how much our dumplings costed. We counted the change to see how much we were
charged (LOL we were so clueless), and they were only 80 dollars! That's only ~$2 for probably 20
delicious dumplings!

As if the night could get any better, we stopped to get taro milk tea at a random shop and it was
*SO GOOD*. One of the guys spoke English and we could point to things on the menu so it was
easy-peasy. He emphasized that it was 50 dollars for a small cup (I'm guessing that's a little more
expensive than a normal drink), but it was actually a perfectly medium size. OMG it was so good.
You could taste the tea and there was lots of real taro chunks and puree and it was piping hot.

We were on the hunt for more street food. We were avoiding places with menus that didn't have
either English or pictures. I think we got lucky at the dumpling place because it seemed like they
only served one kind of dumpling and one kind of soup. We walked into one place asking if they had
an English menu and they sort of said yes, but didn't really understand us. They corrected
themselves and said there was no English and as we turned around, all the ladies in the front
collectively "aww"ed. Then one of them stopped and really hopefully asked if I spoke Japanese, but
I said no, which drew out an even more enthusiastic/funny collective "awwww" and lots of laughs.
We came across this juice stand that had an interesting
sign. My mom later said the boobs represented a milk flavor, but why not use a cow instead...

The other group had a great experience ordering and were really happy they actually
happened to order yummy food so they wanted to come find us to recommend the place, but we bumped
into them on the way out. We hadn't found anything else we wanted to eat on the street so we all went back to
their spot for some beef noodles. Thankfully, they had just been through the ordeal of ordering so
we could just say we wanted what they had.

Our hotel was on top of a huge department store that was like eight floors. We went to check it out
because we got back kind of early. When I hear department store, I think Macy's, but this was more
like lots of vendors under one roof. Imagine the cosmetics section of Macy's, but for every
department. I saw a big sale sign with a big 7 on it, which makes me think "70% off"! In Macy's,
the bigger the number, the better. Here, we figured out that the big number represents the
percentage you pay, so the smaller the number, the better.

I was recommended the flavored beers in Taiwan so I went looking for one. I'm not sure if I found
the right thing but it had a percentage in the corner to I went for it. It was just like a peach-y
soda, so meh.

We went back to one of our hotel rooms and ate some pineapple-custard apple cross, which was yummy. I don't
like this kind as much normal custard apples, though.
