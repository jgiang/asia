We headed to the airport first thing in the morning. Non-US airport security was so lax and we got
through pretty quickly. We realized a little too late that the carbon copies from the Hong Kong
immigration arrival cards were departure cards with all the redundant info filled in. I was so
shocked at how clever that was! Gates in the airport were such a maze. The numbering system made no
sense. I excitedly got a steamed soy milk at starbucks, expecting delicious, hot, fresh soy milk.
It was steamed boxed soy milk, like the American kind (OUTRAGE!). I bought a cute Hong Kong
souvenir cup from the airport Starbucks :( what kind of tourist am I?! But it was cheaper than
advertised and I got a free drink so that kind of made up for my disappointing soy milk, *yay*. The
plane ride to Taiwan was only 1.5 hrs and I really wanted to watch food shows but all the PA
announcements in every language were interrupting. But once those were over, they passed out
snacks!

The immigration line in Taiwan took FOREVER. It spiraled on and on like a line at Disneyland,
except there was nothing exciting at the end, just a grumpy looking airport person. Then we got to
baggage claim and found all the bags of the people still stuck in the immigration line. Airport
people were trying their best to take bags off the carousel as fast as possible, but it still
jammed and shut down. Then we found my aunt's bag all torn apart. Luckily the inner lining hadn't
ripped, but finding a replacement would be difficult given that we would be on a 5-day tour without
much free time to venture out.

The 5-day tour started early this morning, but our flight arrived later so we had to be driven
about 3 hours to meet up with them at Sun Moon Lake. Seeing the spread-out-ness of Taiwan was soooo
welcome after being pent up in Hong Kong. We stopped at a rest stop that was so gourmet compared to
the ones I'm used to. It smelled so good.

My mom is the only one that speaks/understands Chinese so she got to talk to the driver and learn
fun tidbits, while we stared out the window and slept. A thing to note: my mom is a bad translator.
She takes forever to process things. If there are any symbols or pictures, we usually guess the
meaning faster than she can. We met up with the tour group at Wenwu Temple, right by our hotel
(more on it later). We were the late-comers so I already felt that overwhelming anxiousness that
everyone probably knew each other and they were all friends and that we were the odd ones out
(hello, repressed high school memories!). I immediately knew I really really disliked one of the
guys because we was asking so many ridiculous, stupid questions (yes, he proved that stupid
questions do exist). And poof, all my fears of being left out were gone. But on a brighter note,
the tour guide was entertaining and talked about interesting stuff.

Our hotel was super ritzy and the tour guide kept saying that it's the best one in Taiwan
(I couldn't find much to back that on the internet). It was beautiful, the staff was excellent, and
there were plenty of little luxuries that made it feel really special. The busboy took off his
shoes when bringing our luggage in (from then on I felt obligated to take my shoes off too). There
was a bidet and I was so excited (a goal of mine is to own one of these smart toilets with a bidet
built-in).

Since the hotel was remote/isolated, we had dinner at the buffet. It was glorious. Comparable to
Vegas buffets. The sashimi was delicious, but dessert was (/is always) my favorite part. They even
delivered fresh egg tarts to each table!

We went to inquire about the hot springs after dinner. It didn't happen because I think everyone was super 
full and there just wasn't a big enough group of us that wanted to go. It wasn't until a day or two
later, after we left the hotel, that I realized the bath water in our rooms was also hot spring water! I was 
*soooo* bummed I missed out on that.

We ended up all hanging out in the biggest room we had. When we realized the rooms all had yukatas
in them, we sent my dad out to go grab some more so we could take a fun group photo. This meant
that my dad went to two of our other rooms and came back carrying 8 bags of yukatas. If anyone saw
him, it would totally look like he was stealing/hoarding them, which we found hilarious.
