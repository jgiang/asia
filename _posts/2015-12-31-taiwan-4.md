Our first stop was Xiaoyeliu sandstone park, which was alright.

The tour already had a brownie point for entertaining me with fun fruit facts the other day. But
today, it got so many more brownie points for playing **Josh Groban**!

We had a long way to drive so we stopped for buns instead of a full sitdown lunch.

We then stoped at the eight-arch bridge to Sansientai. The bridge doesn't seem very practical but
it sure looks cool. It was also super windy here, making selfies difficult.

We passed a couple of cool caves that looked really interesting. I think we stopped at/near the
Tropic of Cancer(?) or the highest point along Taiwan's East Coast highway. We also went on
a mini-tour of a marble factory, which was pretty boring but there were a bunch of fun statues in
front of the factory.

We walked through part of Swallow Grotto, until the path gets too sketch. We had to wear hardhats,
which provided for a fun selfie. Some of the cliffs were 600m high so I couldn't see the top or the
sky from my seat in the bus, which was pretty cool.

The road to the hotel that goes through Swallow Grotto and "the Gorge" was really windy and narrow.
Apparently buses had radios that they set to certain frequencies to announce that they are going
through a narrow part because only one can pass at a time. Since non-buses can't communicate, they
often just go for it, forcing our bus driver to back up along the windy, cliff-y road to give way!
When the hand radios work successfully, the buses act as road blocks for each other when traveling
in opposite directions.

We finally got to the hotel and immediately went to dinner for the first seating to avoid the big rush 
of people later. The pork ribs were so good! They took forever to bring out the food so taking one
big dinner photo wasn't possible.

Some of us went hot tubbing after dinner to kill time before the New Years Eve aboriginal dance
show and concert. The hot tubs and pool were on the rooftop, which looked out into "the Gorge"
which was really cool. I didn't think I would ever find myself hot-tubbing right up next to
a gigantic mountain.

Some of us stayed out on the roof for the New Years countdown party. I got a "tequila boom" to
celebrate the occasion, which tasted like a margarita. The rooftop in the middle of the Taroko
National Park was such a surreal place to being counting down.
