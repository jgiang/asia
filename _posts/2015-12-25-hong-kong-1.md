We had a couple of hours to burn before we could check-in to our rooms at the hotel so we walked
down Nathan Road. I felt pretty gross after 16 hours on a plane, but we were on a hunt for wonton
noodle soup so I was well-distracted from the feeling.

A couple blocks south of our hotel was
[Australia Dairy Company](http://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/jordan-australia-dairy-company/90). We hadn't seen any lines during our search for a poppin' lunch spot, but this
place had a line that was about to wrap around the block! We were thoroughly confused because 1.
Australia, not Hong Kong and 2. there were only a bunch of milk bottles in the window.

We left
determined to figure out what they had to offer once we found wifi. We ended up going to dim sum
because the good-looking noodle places were either closed or they couldn't accommodate a party of
11. [Federal Palace Dim Sum](http://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/tung-chung-federal-palace-restaurant/15562) was yummy (the chicken feet were really good). When they brought out
the check, they also had predicted what bills we would be paying with and had exact change all
ready.

After dim sum, we walked around to kill some more time. We found an outdoor
produce/fruit/meat/seafood market, which eventually led us to Jade Market.

We eventually checked-in
to our rooms and relaxed/washed up before dinner. I finally got to use one of those rain-like
vertical showerhead things and it was great. Also, the lights in the room are controlled by a
controller next to the beds so you never have to get up! Coolest of all, the room came with
a cellphone (with unlimited data) that you could take on the town.

We walked to Tsim Sha Shui to
see the Symphony of Lights at the harbor but were too early so we wandered around looking for
a dinner place. We settled on [Hing
Fat](http://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/tsim-sha-tsui-hing-fat-roast-restaurant/1205)
and ended up missing the light show.

On our way back to our hotel, we stopped at Australia Dairy
Company, which was sooooo delicious.

Nice and content after dessert, we walked through Temple
Street Night Market, which was packed. Most of the stands sold the same junky, chinatown-type stuff
so it wasn't super interesting. Watching people bargain is always entertaining though.
