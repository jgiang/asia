The trip started off with us being stuck in holiday LAX traffic for almost two hours. Plenty of
time for photos of the iconic LAX light fixtures. They were looking a lot like giant cucumbers.

Surprisingly, the luggage check-in and security lines were quick. My brother and I decided to try
out the empty "self check-in bag drop" line. Turned out that the line was for people who had
printed out their boarding passes, but the guy was really nice and processed us anyway. We beat the
system and the rest of the family waited in the "economy class" line with everyone else (teehee).

It had been so long since I traveled through an international terminal. They're so much nicer and
more fun than the domestic ones. We found a "Starbucks Evenings" that serves wine, but didn't have
the time to enjoy a glass. I wonder if I can use my free drink to get some wine on the way back!

I don't think anyone realized until this night that we would be on a plane for almost 16 hours!
Luckily, the entertainment selection was excellent. My plan to beat jetlag was to stay up for the first 5 or
6 hours and knock out for a good 10 hours towards the end of the flight, waking up at about
8 o'clock Hong Kong time. Unfortunately, the movies were too tempting and I, of course, prioritized
the food schedule above the sleep schedule. Here are some photos of our food to fill up this boring
post about our flight.

I *REALLY* enjoyed sleeping between the clouds and the stars. It was so pretty! I brought along my
favorite eeyore, named Christmas (how appropriate for this trip), and really soft blanket-like
booties. My feet were still freezing but I could sleep without the fear of being dragged away by
them.

The flight attendants made us close the window covers as the sun was rising. It was a bummer, but
I took a sneaky photo anyway. At one point, the clouds looked really weirdly flat. Among the
endless entertainment options, there was live video from a camera underneath the plane! It wasn't
the greatest quality but cool nonetheless.

As we descended towards Hong Kong, it was announced that it would be cloudy and possibly rainy, but
the sun was shining so brightly. Sadly, they were right. We went beneath a thick layer of clouds
and the sun was nowhere to be seen.

As we were disembarking, all of the crew were saying "Merry Christmas!". We realized that it was
not only Christmas, but also Di Ti's birthday! I still feel like I was cheated out of a Christmas Eve
though. It's probably time to come to terms with the fact that this holiday season isn't going to be very festive.

As soon as we got off the plane, the humidity hit us. It's kind of gross, but not unbearable
because the weather is pretty cool at the moment. Here we are, trying our best to not look nasty
and tired.

It took us an hour on a shuttle to get from the airport to our hotel. We probably arrived around
10:30 am, but check-in wasn't until 3 pm. We left our luggage with the concierge and started our
first day in Hong Kong...
