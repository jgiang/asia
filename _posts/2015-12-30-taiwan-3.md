When we got on the bus, we found out that nobody knows how to listen to directions. It's not just
in school that people don't pay attention/understand such simple things! Everyone was in the wrong
seat so the tour guide had to come in and ask people where they sat yesterday and direct them to
their new seat. One lady refused to move to the back of the bus, even though everyone else was
rotating. It took a good 10 minutes of her arguing and the tour guide being so amazingly patient
and civil for her to move. She continued complaining when she was in the back. I'm not sure what
her argument was though because everyone else was in the same boat. I'm pretty sure she's the kind
of person I hate, who enjoys arguing and creating drama.

We stopped at Maobitou to look at coral formations. So much of Taiwan used to be under sea-level
and the remnants are cool.

One of the European guys in our group was handing out Swiss chocolates to everyone on our way back
into the bus, which was great! We then stopped for lunch at Kenting National Forest Recreation
Area. The clams went fast so they aren't pictured teehee.

I found a coffee jelly snack that I used to love as a kid. I always look for it at the Asian
grocery stores like 99 Ranch, but I've never found one. We had just eaten so I didn't get one,
thinking I could jsut grab it later at a different convenience store, but I never found one again
D: It will forever be one of my biggest regrets.

I think this may have been a clothing store but it could also totally be a drug store selling
actual ecstasy. Such dynamic advertising.

We stopped at Eluanbi Park to take a look at Taiwan's biggest or brightest lighthouse and the only
reenforced(?) lighthouse in the world. It has gun holes and whatnot because they had to fight off
aboriginals that would frequently try to raid.

We stopped Longpan Park before our long ride to the hotel. It was so windy that my selfie stick was
really waving in the wind, making it pretty fun to try to get a selfie with such a big group of
people.

I love sleeping in moving cars, but I swear this bus is magical. It puts me to sleep immediately,
even if the trip is going to be super short. All the long rides end up seeming short because I'm
passed out the whole time. Sadly, this meant that I missed looking out along most of the East
Scenic Coast Highway. We stopped for snacks because our hotel is remote/isolated. I had been dying
to try some instant noodles so we all got a bowl thinking we could skimp on dinner time for more
hot spring bath time. I really wanted chili-crab noodles but couldn't find any :(

Update: bidets are awesome except when they don't have fans built-in. The bidet at the first hotel
was superior.

After our instant noodle party, some of us went to see the Taiwanese aboriginal Bunun dance show.
"Aboriginal" seems like a bad word, but that's the term everyone used and I probably won't always
know the tribe names. After the show, I called it a night and spent an hour in my bath watching
Youtube.
