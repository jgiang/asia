Having been to night markets in Taiwan, I was really bored at the ones in Hong Kong. The
food-to-junk ratio was totally off! Other than seeing all the sights for the first time and
exploring the neighborhood, the food wasn't amazing enough to justify a trip back to Hong Kong. It
was just too crowded and noisy for my liking. Some interesting parts of Hong Kong are detailed
below:

According to my brother, there are lots of cool cars that we don't get in the US. I definitely saw
lots of cute hatchbacks.

There is SO much shopping. On the big street our hotel was on, Nathan Road, there were dozens of
huge shopping centers, many with the same exact stores merely a couple blocks apart. They are really into
expensive watches and jewelry, which appear in most of the windows we walked by.

Some restaurants give you bowls, boiling water, and chopsticks (to handle things in the hot water)
to rinse your tableware, but nothing to dry them with. Which brings us to the next point...

A lot of restaurants don't give you napkins, not sure why, so this roll of toilet paper hanging
above the tables (at the noodle place in Stanley Market) was a little luxury.

On a similar note, restroom quality varies so widely, even just door-to-door. Many toilets don't
have toilet paper, which drives me crazy! Also, I'm so not into the squatting toilets. I'm totally
that tourist that creates the sitting-toilet-only line.

There are signs all over the place that make it really easy to navigate aruond Hong Kong as
a tourist. Every corner tells you which way to look to check for on-coming traffic. They drive on
the opposite side of the street. The signs on the MTR are super informative. They tell you the next
stop, the direction you're headed, when to transfer, and which side to exit from. All of this on
a lit up sign so you don't have to listen carefully to the announcements.
