We woke up surprisingly early after our first night's sleep on the other side of the world. At
about 7:30 we found ourselves in McDonalds because the Starbucks and most local cafes were still
closed (also because I had to try something from a McDonalds in Asia). McDonalds are basically on
every other block here and most of them are open 24 hours! We noticed while walking around last
night that simple macaroni soup is super popular so we decided to give it a try. Maybe McDonalds
isn't a good yardstick but the concensus was "meh". The soy milk was surprisingly good, possibly
even freshly made.

On our way back to the hotel, we stopped at a convenience store to check out the snacks. I found
dark rum meltyblends and FRUIT PASTILLES! I kid you not, nearly half of mine were green. It was
amazing.

We got picked up at our hotel for a day tour of Hong Kong. We got a private little shuttle for the
11 of us.

Our first stop was at The Peak Tram, which was like a cable car that went up a mountain. It stopped
at Victoria Peak and we went up to the Sky Terrace, which had great views of Hong Kong island.

Our next stop was at Repulse Bay, which is supposed to be one of the most exclusive places to live
in Hong Kong, despite its name. Repulse Beach is man-made, which was kinda weird. There is also
a building with a gigantic hole through the middle of it, supposedly to perfect the feng shui. Next
to the beach was Tin Hau Temple. My grandma is infamous for leaving her things behind and getting
lost by wandering apart from the group. There was a good 5 minutes of panic when we lost her on the
way to the van. She took a detour and went into the shopping center, thinking we had gone in to use
the restrooms. Not sure what made her turn into the building instead of continuing straight with
us.

We continued to Stanley Market, which is very much like chinatown. There are many stalls lined up,
selling little knicknacks. The best part was eating at a "hole in the stalls" restaurant and
finally getting real Hong Kong egg noodles. At first we peered in and figured they couldn't
accommodate 11 people, but they led us around the seating in the front to a private dining room!
The room itself was the menu because there were pictures of everything on all the walls.

The noodles were nice and springy, possibly freshly made there.
